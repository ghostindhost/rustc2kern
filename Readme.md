# rootkit-c2-rust

A modular, research-friendly Windows kernel C2 framework in Rust.

## Project Structure

rootkit-c2-rust/
├── c2_server/ # Operator dashboard and C2 backend (Rust, async, analytics)
├── user_client/ # Async behavioral client and driver relay (Rust)
├── driver/ # Windows kernel driver (Rust, research-safe)
└── README.md # This file


## Modules

- **c2_server/**: Operator dashboard, analytics, flexible command queues, JWT key rotation, IP allowlisting, replay defense.
- **user_client/**: Async event collection, batching, robust error handling, driver communication.
- **driver/**: Device creation, IRP dispatch, WPP/DbgPrint logging, access control, buffer safety.

## Build Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (nightly for kernel driver, stable for others)
- Windows WDK (for driver)
- OpenSSL (for certificates)
- Node.js (optional, for dashboard UI tweaks)
- [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) or WinDbg for kernel logs

## Build Instructions

See each module's README for details.

## Usage

1. Generate and distribute TLS certificates as described in the c2_server and user_client READMEs.
2. Build each component.
3. Start the C2 server: `./target/release/c2_server`
4. Start the client: `./target/release/user_client`
5. Load the driver (test-signing mode, admin required).
6. Use the dashboard at https://localhost:8443/dashboard to queue commands for specific clients (by behavioral hash).
7. Monitor analytics at https://localhost:8443/analytics.

**Legal Notice:**  
For educational and defensive research only.  
Never deploy or test rootkits on systems you do not own or without explicit permission.

# c2_server

Rust-based C2 server with operator dashboard, analytics, flexible command queues, JWT key rotation, IP allowlisting, and replay defense.

## Structure





c2_server/
├── src/
│ ├── main.rs
│ └── dashboard.html
├── Cargo.toml

## Build Instructions

1. **Install Rust (stable):**

rustup install stable
rustup default stable

text

2. **Install dependencies:**

cd c2_server
cargo build --release

3. **Certificates:**  
Generate or obtain TLS certificates for HTTPS if you want to use real HTTPS (see user_client README for example OpenSSL commands).

## Usage

1. **Start the server:**

./target/release/c2_server

text

2. **Operator dashboard:**  
Open [https://localhost:8443/dashboard](https://localhost:8443/dashboard) in your browser.
- Queue commands for specific behavioral hashes (clients).
- View analytics at `/analytics`.

3. **API endpoints:**
- `POST /command`: Used by clients to fetch commands and send behavioral data.
- `POST /queue`: Used by operator dashboard to queue commands for a client.
- `GET /analytics`: Returns JSON analytics data.

## Features

- **Operator dashboard** for queuing commands per-client.
- **Analytics**: See frequency of behavioral hashes and event submissions.
- **Flexible commands**: Each client can have its own command queue.
- **Security**: JWT key rotation, IP allowlisting, replay defense.

## Notes

- For production, use strong JWT keys and real HTTPS certificates.
- The dashboard is a simple HTML/JS file served by the Rust backend.

# user_client

Async Rust client for behavioral event collection, batching, robust C2 comms, and Windows kernel driver relay.

## Structure

user_client/
├── src/
│ ├── main.rs
│ ├── behavioral.rs
│ ├── c2_comm.rs
│ └── driver_comm.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── client.p12 # Client certificate (PKCS#12)
├── ca_cert.pem # CA certificate

text

## Build Instructions

1. **Install Rust (stable):**

rustup install stable
rustup default stable

text

2. **Install dependencies:**

cd user_client
cargo build --release

text

3. **Certificates:**  
- Place `client.p12` (PKCS#12 format) and `ca_cert.pem` in this directory.
- See c2_server README for OpenSSL commands.

## Usage

1. **Run the client:**

./target/release/user_client

text

2. **What it does:**
- Collects keystroke and mouse events in the background.
- Batches and sends behavioral data every 5 seconds to the C2 server.
- Receives a command from the C2 server.
- Relays the command to the kernel driver via IOCTL and prints the response.

## Notes

- Requires administrator privileges to communicate with the kernel driver.
- For research and blue team use, you can modify the event collection or add more behavioral signals.
- All network comms are async and robustly error-handled.

# driver

Windows kernel driver (Rust, research-safe) for C2 command relay and behavioral research.

│ ├── lib.rs
│ ├── entry.rs
│ ├── comms.rs
│ ├── actions.rs
│ └── utils.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── .cargo/
│ └── config.toml
├── driver.inx

text

## Build Instructions

1. **Install Rust (nightly):**

rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly

text

2. **Install Win

dows WDK and add to PATH.**

3. **Build the driver:**

cd driver
cargo build --release

text

> **Note:** You may need to set up a custom target for Windows kernel drivers. See [windows-drivers-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs) for details.

4. **Sign the driver (test signing):**
- Use the WDK tools (`signtool.exe`) and enable test signing on your VM.

5. **Install the driver:**
- Use `sc.exe create` or Device Manager (with `driver.inx` as INF).

## Usage

- The driver creates `\\.\RootkitC2` device for user-mode communication.
- Only SYSTEM (session 0) can send IOCTLs (access control).
- All actions are stubbed for safety (no real rootkit actions).
- Logs to kernel debugger with WPP (`wdk::trace!`) and DbgPrint.

## Notes

- Use [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) or WinDbg to view kernel logs.
- For production or advanced research, expand the IRP dispatch and access control as needed.
- This driver is for educational and research purposes only.
